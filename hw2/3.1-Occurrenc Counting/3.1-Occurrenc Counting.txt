					Description:
				
				
					Write a program
  that reads in an array of type int from a file&#44; the file named
				
				
					“intArray.txt”. Please note that the number of entries is
  not limited. Your 
				
				
					program determines how many entries are used. The output is
  to be a two-column 
				
				
					list. The first column is a list of the distinct array
  elements; the second 
				
				
					column is the count of the number of occurrences of each
  element. The list 
				
				
					should be sorted on entries in the first column&#44; largest to
  smallest.
				
				
					Input:
				
				
					For the array
  values: –12 3 –12 4 1 1 –12 1 –1 1 2 3 4 2 3 –12
				
				
					Output:
				
				
					N Count
				
				
					4 2
				
				
					3 3
				
				
					2 2
				
				
					1 4
				
				
					–1 1
				
				
					–12 4
				
				
					The two integers
  are divided by one tab(\t).

					■ Eazy&#44;Only basic programming syntax and structure
  are required.
				
				
					□ Medium&#44;Multiple programming grammars and structures
  are required.
				
				
					□ Hard&#44;Need to use multiple program structures or
  more complex data types.
