					Description:
				
				
					The type Point is a fairly simple data type&#44; but under
  another name (the template class pair) this data type is defined and used in
  the C++ Standard Template Library&#44; although you need not know anything about
  the Standard Template Library to do this exercise. Write a definition of a
  class named Point that might be
  used to store and manipulate the location of a point in the plane. You will
  need to declare and implement the following member functions:
				
				
					a.A member function set that sets the private data after an
  object of this class is created.
				
				
					b. A member function to move the point by an amount along
  the vertical and horizontal directions specified by the first and second
  arguments.
				
				
					c.A member function to rotate the point by 90 degrees
  clockwise around the origin.
				
				
					d.Two const inspector functions to retrieve the current
  coordinates of the point.
				
				
					Document these functions with appropriate comments. embed
  your class in a test program that requests data for several points from the
  user&#44; creates the points&#44; then exercises the member functions.
				
				
					Input:
				
				
					Replace the main
  from main.cpp.

					□ Eazy&#44;Only basic programming syntax and structure
  are required.
				
				
					■ Medium&#44;Multiple programming grammars and structures
  are required.
				
				
					□ Hard&#44;Need to use multiple program structures or
  more complex data types.
